        Here's a list of features / patterns which are marked for removal.
        
        Expect the following for items included here:
            - a description of the pattern / feature
            - what should be used instead
            - examples of both the old and new way
            - some indication of the extent and/or priority of deprecation

        ## SX props aka Namespaced Props
        see [MUI sx Prop Docs](https://mui.com/system/getting-started/the-sx-prop/)

        For certain MUI components, an `sx` prop is required.  This is valid JSX (React), but not valid XML (AW Framework).
        ```jsx
            <ReactComponent
                sx={{ prop1:true, prop2:false }}
            />
        ```

        We used to get around this using a comma/colon-delimited string which we gave special treatment, aka the `sx` prop. See below.   

        This is not compatible with using `WHEN` syntax in props, so we take advantage of XML's namespace convention, ie. `namespace:prop`.

        We now do a transform of ***any*** property name (not just `sx`) which results in several props in a namespace being squashed together into one object.

        NOTE: this applies to visual components like `Box` or `IconButton`, but it has not yet been applied to non-visual components like `Data` or `Flows`.

        #### OLD WAY:
        *this will still work, but is not compatible with WHEN props, for example*
        ```xml
            <AWFrameworkComponent
                sx="prop1:true,prop2:false"
            />
        ```

        #### NEW WAY:
        *compatible with WHEN props and is probably easier to read*
        ```xml
            <AWFrameworkComponent
                sx:prop1="true"
                sx:prop2="false"
            />
        ```
