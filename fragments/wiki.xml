                Welcome to the knowledge center of your project. This wiki is where ideas are captured, knowledge is shared, and decisions are documented.

                This is a **living space** for guides, definitions, specs, and team learnings—designed to evolve as your project grows.

                ### 🧭 What Belongs Here?

                Think of this as the **operational memory** of your team. This space is ideal for:

                - Setup instructions for developers, testers, and designers  
                - Policies, naming conventions, and process guides  
                - Architecture diagrams and API overviews  
                - Project principles, goals, and key decisions  
                - Postmortems, retrospectives, and lessons learned  
                - Integration notes with third-party tools or platforms

                Anything that someone joining the team later will wish existed—**belongs here now**.

                ### ✍️ Writing Good Wiki Entries

                A few tips to keep content useful and durable:

                - Use **clear titles** and consistent formatting  
                - Prefer brevity over verbosity, but don’t sacrifice clarity  
                - Break long content into sections with headers  
                - Link to related wiki entries or external resources  
                - Use checklists, tables, or diagrams where helpful

                Each entry should answer: *What is this? Why does it matter? How do I use it?*

                ### 🧱 Suggested Categories

                Structure helps people find what they need. Some categories you may want to create:

                - **Getting Started** – onboarding steps, tool setup, accounts to request  
                - **Engineering** – coding standards, deployment process, CI/CD details  
                - **Product** – user flows, feature specs, definitions of done  
                - **Design** – design system, color palette, UX principles  
                - **Business** – timelines, contracts, KPIs, stakeholders  
                - **Glossary** – acronyms and terms specific to your domain

                Organized documentation is 10× more useful than scattered brilliance.

                ### 💬 Collaborative Editing

                This wiki isn’t just a read-only space. You’re encouraged to:

                - Create new pages  
                - Refactor existing content  
                - Update outdated instructions  
                - Flag content that needs clarification  
                - Comment with questions or suggestions

                Knowledge should be maintained by **everyone**, not just the “documentation person.”

                ---

                ### 🔍 Search, Tags, and Navigation

                Once your wiki grows, features like:

                - Full-text search  
                - Tag filters  
                - Sidebar navigation  
                - Page linking and backlinks  

                ...will help reduce noise and make information **discoverable** when needed most.

                ---

                ### 🧠 Final Thought

                If your project lost every contributor today, could someone new pick up the pieces?

                This wiki is your answer to that question. It’s not about documenting everything—just the parts that matter when things get hard or messy.

                Write with your future team in mind.
