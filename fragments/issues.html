				🧩 What is an "Issue" Anyway?
			</x-typography>

			<x-typography
				variant="body1"
				sx:mb="4"
			>
				An issue can be anything that blocks, degrades, or misaligns with
				expected project outcomes. It might be a broken feature, a missing
				component, a data mismatch, or even a process flaw. Not every issue is a
				bug—some are signals of friction in your team or tools.

				🚨 Urgency vs. Impact
			</x-typography>

			<x-typography
				variant="body1"
				sx:mb="4"
			>
				Not all issues are equal. A crash in a rarely used admin panel may be
				less critical than a minor typo on your login page. Reporting both is
				valuable—but tagging them with the correct
				<strong>priority</strong> helps focus energy where it matters most.

				🧠 Make Issues Actionable
			</x-typography>

			<x-typography

				Avoid vague titles like "Login broken" or "Search doesn't work."
				Instead, try:
			</x-typography>

				Make sure your <strong>steps to reproduce</strong> are unambiguous.
				Assume the person fixing it knows nothing about your environment unless
				you tell them.

				Each issue enters a triage workflow:
			</x-typography>

			<x-box
				sx:ml="2"
				sx:mb="4"

				<x-typography variant="body1"

			</x-box>

			<x-typography

				You'll often see updates, comments, or questions—responding quickly

				🧭 Tags and Metadata
			</x-typography>

			<x-typography
				variant="body1"
				sx:mb="2"
			>
				Use tags like:
			</x-typography>

			<x-box
				sx:ml="2"
				sx:mb="4"
			>
				<x-typography variant="body1"
					>- <code>#frontend</code> / <code>#backend</code></x-typography
				>
				<x-typography variant="body1"
					>- <code>#critical</code>, <code>#low-priority</code></x-typography
				>
				<x-typography variant="body1"
					>- <code>#ux</code>, <code>#performance</code>,
					<code>#security</code></x-typography
				>
			</x-box>

			<x-typography
				variant="body1"

				Tags allow for smarter filtering, faster search, and better visibility

				🧪 The Value of Patterns
			</x-typography>

			<x-typography
				variant="body1"
				sx:mb="4"
			>
				Even if a single issue seems small, patterns across many reports expose
				systemic problems. Frequent low-priority issues might reveal poor UX or
				inconsistent data handling. Reporting helps us spot those trends early.

				🤝 Team Collaboration
			</x-typography>

			<x-typography
				variant="body1"
				sx:mb="4"
			>
				An issue report is a conversation starter. Devs, designers, QA, and PMs
				often collaborate on clarifying, testing, and resolving it. The clearer
				your starting point, the faster the conversation moves.
			</x-typography>

			<x-typography

			>
				🔐 Confidentiality
			</x-typography>

			<x-typography
				variant="body1"
				sx:mb="4"
			>
				If an issue involves sensitive data or security vulnerabilities, flag it
				accordingly. Some issue types may need restricted visibility or private
				triage—this protects your users and organization.

				Just like our product, our issue system is a work in progress. If you
				notice any friction in how you submit, view, or track issues—ironically,
