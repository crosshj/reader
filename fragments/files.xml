            Files are more than just attachments—they are the **persistent artifacts** of a project’s work, ideas, and decisions. This section serves as your centralized repository for everything from design assets to stakeholder sign-off docs.

            ### 📁 Why File Management Matters

            - Keeps all contributors on the same page  
            - Prevents version conflicts and outdated references  
            - Reduces time lost to digging through chat threads or email chains  

            Centralizing files avoids knowledge silos and provides a **shared source of truth**. When you use structured file storage, team members can quickly locate what they need and focus on what matters.

            ### 🧭 Organizing Your Files

            A good file system starts with structure. Consider:

            - **Naming conventions** (e.g., `2025-04-DesignSpecs-v1.2.pdf`)
            - **Consistent folder hierarchy**
            - Tags for priority, confidentiality, or lifecycle stage

            Use folders to segment work:  
            `/Designs`, `/Specs`, `/Contracts`, `/Deliverables`, `/Archive`

            ### 🔍 Search and Discovery

            Even with structure, quick access matters. This page may eventually include:

            - Keyword search
            - File previews (images, docs)
            - Sort by date, name, or uploader

            These improvements make the file system feel *alive*—not static.

            ### ✅ Use Cases

            **During active work:**

            - Upload and share WIP docs  
            - Exchange drafts with reviewers  
            - Store shared templates

            **After project delivery:**

            - Archive assets for compliance  
            - Retain documentation for knowledge transfer  
            - Track what decisions were made and why

            ---

            ### 🔒 Permissions and Responsibility

            Every file has a footprint—who uploaded it, when, and why.

            - Enforce access control for sensitive files  
            - Versioning support lets you recover from mistakes  
            - Metadata (author, date, size, tags) adds clarity

            ---

            ### 🧠 Final Tip

            Think of this page as the *memory* of your project. Use it well, and future contributors—even your future self—will thank you.
