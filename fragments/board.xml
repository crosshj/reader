                ## 🗂️ Your Kanban Board

                This is your Kanban board for organizing tasks.

                - **Backlog** for new or unprioritized tasks  
                - **In Progress** for items being actively worked on  
                - **Done** for completed items  

                ---

                ### ✨ Features at a Glance

                - You can **drag and drop** cards between columns.  
                - This board focuses on **core functionality**, without extra bells and whistles.  
                - It's great for **quick task management** and **visual clarity**.  

                ---

                ### 📌 Why Use a Kanban Board?

                Kanban helps break down your workflow into manageable chunks. Instead of being overwhelmed by a massive list, tasks move clearly from “To Do” to “Doing” to “Done.” This mirrors real-life progress and helps you **visualize momentum**.

                It’s especially effective in fast-moving teams where priorities shift often. The board gives you a snapshot of the current state at a glance—no need to dig through issue trackers or spreadsheets.

                ### 🔄 Real-Time Collaboration

                Multiple team members can update the board simultaneously. This makes it ideal for:

                - Stand-ups  
                - Sprint planning  
                - Visualizing blockers  
                - Tracking daily throughput  

                Unlike traditional task lists, a Kanban board encourages a living, **interactive workflow**. Updates are reflected instantly, giving everyone the same real-time perspective.

                ---

                ### 🧠 Working Agreements and WIP Limits

                Kanban isn’t just visual—it’s about discipline. Many teams define **Work In Progress (WIP) limits** to reduce multitasking and improve throughput. For example:

                > Limit “In Progress” to 3 tasks per person

                This encourages focus and finishes over starts. It's easy to introduce policies like this gradually and reinforce them through team habits.

                ---

                ### 🚦 Identifying Bottlenecks

                Columns that fill up quickly signal friction. If you constantly have 10+ items in “In Progress” but nothing moving to “Done,” that’s insight. The board becomes not just a tracker—but a **diagnostic tool**.

                ---

                ### 📁 Attachments, Tags, and Beyond (Future Features)

                This basic board keeps things lean. But you may eventually extend it with:

                - Labels for priority, category, or owner  
                - File attachments or checklists  
                - Card comments and history  
                - Automation (e.g. move to Done when checkbox list is complete)

                For now, enjoy the simplicity. You’re free to manage work *without distraction.*

                ---

                ### ✅ Final Thought

                A Kanban board only works if it’s updated. Treat this as a **living surface**—drag, drop, prune, add. The more you use it, the more valuable it becomes.
